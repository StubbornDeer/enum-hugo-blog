<div class="convo me"><span>Hey Mike, how's it going with your business?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Ugh, it's a nightmare. üò© I'm swamped and totally exhausted. ü§î</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Why</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Users, customers, clients they all want something from me all the time. Yesterday I even didn't brush my teeth</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Have you ever thought about using a chatbot to help out? Like Enum?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>A chatbot? Enum? What the heck is that. I dunno, sounds complicated.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Nah, it's actually super easy to set up. Plus, it can take a load off your shoulders.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Easy? How easy are we talking?</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Like, you could probably get it up and running during our chat. It's pretty much plug and play.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Hmm, not sure. What if it says something dumb or can't find the info?</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>It's smarter than you think. It can keep the convo and can access your data.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Which data?</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Like your website. Or, I remember, you had something stored as pdf.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Alright, I'll give it a shot. But if this backfires, I'm sending the bots after you!üòÖ</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Deal! Let me know how it goes.</span></div>

<div class="convo divider">Day later...</div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Okay, not gonna lie, setting up that chatbot was a piece of cake.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Told ya! How's it handling the requests?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>So far, so good. I keep waiting for it to mess up, but it's been solid.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>See? You can start to relax a bit now.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Yeah, I guess. I'm still keeping an eye on it, though.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Of course. It'll take some time to trust the process.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Very funny, but the chatbot handled a spam query like a champ.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Oh yeah? How'd it go down?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Just gave them the bureaucratic runaround.üòÇ It was like watching a pro at work.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>This was nice haha.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Let's see more.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Next step, world domination with chatbots.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Also, I added the Instruments feature to my project.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Ah, yeah. I use them too. How's it working out?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>It's actually helping users track their orders. I'm impressed.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Awesome! Anything else it's been doing?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Well, it's answering FAQs and following up with customers.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Sounds like it's becoming your right-hand bot.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Yeah, it's freeing up my time. I'm not ready to throw a parade, but it's cool.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Small victories, Mike. Small victories.</span></div>

<div class="convo divider">Next day...</div>

<div class="convo them"><span>F! The chatbot just upsold a customer on an accessory. I didn't even know it could do that.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Making money in your sleep, huh?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Seems like it. I'm still not used to this "hands-off" approach.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>It'll grow on you. </span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>It's been gathering feedback for our services. It was soooo easy to add. It's asking right in the same window. Some of the insights are actually useful.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Look at you, getting all this valuable data without lifting a finger!</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Yeah, yeah. Don't rub it in. üòè</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>But it handled it well?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Perfectly, according to the prompt. Customer seemed happy.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Cool! It's doing its job.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>I guess. It's weird not being in the weeds with everything.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>It's called scaling, my friend. Welcome to the club.üçªüçªüçª</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Cheers to that. Still, I'm watching it like a hawk.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Old habits die hard, huh?</span></div>

<div class="convo divider">2 days later...</div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Had a customer with a weird issue, and the bot actually escalated it to me.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Sounds interesting.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>True. It didn't try to wing it and make things worse.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>It's like having a smart assistant who knows their limits.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>I'm starting to see the benefits. Still not throwing a party for it, though.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>No need for a party, just enjoy the peace of mind.</span></div>

<div class="convo divider">2 days later...</div>

<div class="convo me"><span>How is it going?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Good. Really good. You won't believe in it but I'm actually getting used to this.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Welcome to the future, Mike. Chatbots and chill.üòéüòé</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Haha, maybe. I'll admit, it's nice not being glued to my desk. But there is a problem.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>What is that?</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>I donno what to do with my time. I have too much free time now, wtf!</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>That's the spirit! You can start another business or take Emily to the zoo... finally...</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Oh yeah. I will. Thanks for the push towards the bots.</span></div>

<div class="convo me"><span>Anytime, man. Here's to less stress and more success.</span></div>

<div class="convo them"><span>Cheers to that.ü•Ç</span></div>

<div class="convo note">This dialog was written with the small help of the Enum chatbot. Based on a true story.</div>
