<div class="convo me">Hey Mike, how's it going with your business?</div>

<div class="convo them">Ugh, it's a nightmare. üò© I'm swamped and totally exhausted. ü§î</div>

<div class="convo me">Why</div>

<div class="convo them">Users, customers, clients they all want something from me all the time. Yesterday I even didn't brush my teeth</div>

<div class="convo me">Have you ever thought about using a chatbot to help out? Like Enum?</div>

<div class="convo them">A chatbot? Enum? What the heck is that. I dunno, sounds complicated.</div>

<div class="convo me">Nah, it's actually super easy to set up. Plus, it can take a load off your shoulders.</div>

<div class="convo them">Easy? How easy are we talking?</div>

<div class="convo me">Like, you could probably get it up and running during our chat. It's pretty much plug and play.</div>

<div class="convo them">Hmm, not sure. What if it says something dumb or can't find the info?</div>

<div class="convo me">It's smarter than you think. It can keep the convo and can access your data.</div>

<div class="convo them">Which data?</div>

<div class="convo me">Like your website. Or, I remember, you had something stored as pdf.</div>

<div class="convo them">Alright, I'll give it a shot. But if this backfires, I'm sending the bots after you!üòÖ</div>

<div class="convo me">Deal! Let me know how it goes.</div>

<div class="convo divider">Day later...</div>

<div class="convo them">Okay, not gonna lie, setting up that chatbot was a piece of cake.</div>

<div class="convo me">Told ya! How's it handling the requests?</div>

<div class="convo them">So far, so good. I keep waiting for it to mess up, but it's been solid.</div>

<div class="convo me">See? You can start to relax a bit now.</div>

<div class="convo them">Yeah, I guess. I'm still keeping an eye on it, though.</div>

<div class="convo me">Of course. It'll take some time to trust the process.</div>

<div class="convo them">Very funny, but the chatbot handled a spam query like a champ.</div>

<div class="convo me">Oh yeah? How'd it go down?</div>

<div class="convo them">Just gave them the bureaucratic runaround.üòÇ It was like watching a pro at work.</div>

<div class="convo me">This was nice haha.</div>

<div class="convo them">Let's see more.</div>

<div class="convo me">Next step, world domination with chatbots.</div>

<div class="convo them">Also, I added the Instruments feature to Enum.</div>

<div class="convo me">Ah, yeah. I use them too. How's it working out?</div>

<div class="convo them">It's actually helping users track their orders. I'm impressed.</div>

<div class="convo me">Awesome! Anything else it's been doing?</div>

<div class="convo them">Well, it's answering FAQs and following up with customers.</div>

<div class="convo me">Sounds like it's becoming your right-hand bot.</div>

<div class="convo them">Yeah, it's freeing up my time. I'm not ready to throw a parade, but it's cool.</div>

<div class="convo me">Small victories, Mike. Small victories.</div></div>

<div class="convo divider">Next day...</div>

<div class="convo them">F! The chatbot just upsold a customer on an accessory. I didn't even know it could do that.</div>

<div class="convo me">Making money in your sleep, huh?</div>

<div class="convo them">Seems like it. I'm still not used to this "hands-off" approach.</div>

<div class="convo me">It'll grow on you. </div>

<div class="convo them">It's been gathering feedback for our services. It was soooo easy to add. It's asking right in the same window. Some of the insights are actually useful.</div>

<div class="convo me">Look at you, getting all this valuable data without lifting a finger!</div>

<div class="convo them">Yeah, yeah. Don't rub it in. üòè</div>

<div class="convo me">But it handled it well?</div>

<div class="convo them">Perfectly, according to the prompt. Customer seemed happy.</div>

<div class="convo me">Cool! It's doing its job.</div>

<div class="convo them">I guess. It's weird not being in the weeds with everything.</div>

<div class="convo me">It's called scaling, my friend. Welcome to the club.üçªüçªüçª</div>

<div class="convo them">Cheers to that. Still, I'm watching it like a hawk.</div>

<div class="convo me">Old habits die hard, huh?</div>

<div class="convo divider">2 days later...</div>

<div class="convo them">Had a customer with a weird issue, and the bot actually escalated it to me.</div>

<div class="convo me">Sounds interesting.</div>

<div class="convo them">True. It didn't try to wing it and make things worse.</div>

<div class="convo me">It's like having a smart assistant who knows their limits.</div>

<div class="convo them">I'm starting to see the benefits. Still not throwing a party for it, though.</div>

<div class="convo me">No need for a party, just enjoy the peace of mind.</div>

<div class="convo divider">2 days later...</div>

<div class="convo me">How is it going?</div>

<div class="convo them">Good. Really good. You won't believe in it but I'm actually getting used to this.</div>

<div class="convo me">Welcome to the future, Mike. Chatbots and chill.üòéüòé</div>

<div class="convo them">Haha, maybe. I'll admit, it's nice not being glued to my desk. But there is a problem.</div>

<div class="convo me">What is that?</div>

<div class="convo them">I donno what to do with my time. I have too much free time now, wtf!</div>

<div class="convo me">That's the spirit! You can start another business or take Emily to the zoo... finally...</div>

<div class="convo them">Oh yeah. I will. Thanks for the push towards the bots.</div>

<div class="convo me">Anytime, man. Here's to less stress and more success.</div>

<div class="convo them">Cheers to that.ü•Ç</div>

<div class="convo note">This dialog was written with the small help of the Enum chatbot. Based on a true story.</div>
