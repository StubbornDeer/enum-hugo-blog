### Introduction

#### What is the referral program

A referral program is a marketing strategy where existing users are incentivized to refer new users to a product or service. Participants typically share a unique referral code, and when someone uses that code to make a purchase, both the referrer and the new user receive rewards. In Enum, rewards include the 20% upgrade of limits for usage and data.

#### Why to participate?

Participating in Enum's referral program offers a multitude of benefits that can significantly enhance your experience and capabilities within our platform. Here are some compelling reasons why you should get involved:

##### 1. **Increase Your Usage Limits for Free**
By referring new users to Enum, you can increase your usage limits without spending a cent. For every successful referral, both you and your referee receive an additional 20% of the referee's plan limits. This means more messages, more data, and more opportunities to leverage Enum's powerful features.


##### 2. **Be a Part of Our Growth**
Your participation in the referral program helps us grow and improve. By bringing in new users, you contribute to the expansion of our community, which in turn allows us to invest more in developing new features and enhancing our services.

##### 3. **Easy to Share**
Our referral program is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. Creating and sharing your referral code is simple, and you can distribute it through various channels such as social media, personal or corporate blogs, email, or even word of mouth. The more you share, the more you stand to gain.

##### 4. **No Cap on Limits**
Unlike many other programs, Enum's referral program does not have a cap on the limits you can earn. This means the sky's the limit—literally. The more you refer, the higher your limits can go, providing you with unparalleled flexibility and capacity.

##### 5. **Secure and Transparent**
We value transparency and security. You will receive an email notification every time your limits are increased due to a successful referral. You can easily track your progress and see the impact of your referrals in real-time.

##### 6. **Risk-Free Participation**
There is no downside to participating in our referral program. If a referee cancels their subscription, your limits will be adjusted accordingly, but you will not lose any of your original plan limits. Plus, if they resubscribe, your limits will be increased again.


### How It Works

Participating in our referral program is simple and rewarding. Follow these detailed instructions to get started and make the most out of your referrals.

#### 1. Create Your Referral Code
- **Step 1**: Navigate to the **Settings** menu on your dashboard.
- **Step 2**: Click on the **Partnership** item.
- **Step 3**: In the corresponding field, enter a referral code of your choice. Make sure it is easy to copy and share. Avoid using spaces and special characters, except for dashes.
- **Step 4**: Check the availability of your chosen code. If it’s already in use, you will see an error message.
- **Step 5**: Read and agree to the [**Referral Program Terms and Conditions**](https://enumhq.com/referral-terms) by clicking the corresponding checkbox.
- **Step 6**: Save your referral code.

#### 2. Share Your Referral Code
- **Step 1**: Share your referral code with your network. This can include partners, colleagues, friends, followers, or anyone who might benefit from our services.
- **Step 2**: Use various channels to share your code, such as social media, email, or even word of mouth. The more you share, the higher your chances of earning rewards.

#### 3. Your Referee Buys a Subscription
- **Step 1**: If someone doesn’t have an Enum account, they should create one.
- **Step 2**: Encourage them to explore our chatbot and services.
- **Step 3**: When they decide to buy a subscription, they can enter your referral code during the checkout process.
- **Step 4**: Before proceeding, they can click the **Check this referral code** button to ensure the code is valid. If the code doesn’t exist, they will see a corresponding message and can double-check the code.

#### 4. Receive Notification and Check Your Limits
- **Step 1**: Once your referee successfully subscribes using your referral code, you will receive an email notification about the increase in your limits.
- **Step 2**: Navigate to the **Usage/Limits** page on the left menu of your dashboard.
- **Step 3**: Check your updated limits. You will see that your limits have been raised by 20% of your referee’s plan limits.
- **Step 4**: Your referee can also check their limits on their **Usage/Limits** page.

#### 5. Monitor and Maximize Your Referrals
- **Step 1**: Keep track of your referrals and the corresponding increases in your limits.
- **Step 2**: Continue sharing your referral code to maximize your benefits. There is no cap on the limits you can earn, so the more you refer, the higher your limits can go.

### Frequently Asked Questions
- **How exactly is the new limit calculated?**
  - If you are a referrer, you receive an additional 20% of your referee’s plan limits. For example, if your referee’s plan has 1,000 messages a month and your plan’s limit is 100, your new limit will be 100 (your plan limit) + 200 (20% of your referee’s limit) = 300 messages a month.
- **Can I create a referral code if my account is free?**
  - Yes, you can! Even with a free account, you can create a referral code and potentially reach limits equivalent to a paid plan.
- **What happens if my referee cancels their subscription?**
  - If your referee cancels their subscription, your limits will be decreased by 20% of their plan limits. However, if they resubscribe, your limits will be increased again.
- **Does it matter which plan my referee buys?**
  - No, it doesn’t matter. Your increase is always calculated based on your limits, not theirs.
- **Is there a cap on the limits?**
  - Currently, there is no cap on the limits you can earn through referrals.
- **Why did we start this program?**
  - While we may lose a bit on each referee, finding new users and gaining new subscriptions are much more valuable for us. This is why we started the program.
- **Can the program be stopped?**
  - We can stop the program at any moment, but your current earned limits will remain unchanged.
