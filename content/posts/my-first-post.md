### What is the problem?
Users churn. It's the reality we all face some day. And we all keep asking "Why? Why do the hell they go?" What do they need? There are some researches done by independent investigators (mostly businesses) revealing the reasons for it.

For example, Paddle thinks there are 8 reasons for user churn. [They are](https://www.paddle.com/resources/churn-causes):

1. Attracting wrong customers
2. Lacking desired outcomes
3. Poor customer support
4. Lure of competitors
5. Bugs, glitches, downtime
6. Weak value proposition
7. Pricing isn't right
8. Expired credit cards

We agree with them but would like to add that usually, it's not something one, but rather a combination of the reasons. For example, a user faces a glitch and starts looking for another solution - that is cheaper, less glitchy, maybe faster. And if you are restricted by a technology, or some limits of your solution, or even budget, it may be hard to beat the competitors by, say, a speed. Especially if the competitor is a huge corporation (like Google or Microsoft). They have more fastest servers, they have more people to fix all the bugs, they may set up much lower pricing.

So, there is no exit (at the first glance).

But there it is. Because most of big players (and most of all the players no matter how big they are) lacks something very important, something that many users really need from time to time: the support. Yes, it may sound crazy for someone who doesn't know the industry: despite all the effor any company makes into the business, the support is still the weakest area.
