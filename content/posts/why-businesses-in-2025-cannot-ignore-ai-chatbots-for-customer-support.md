# Do you know where businesses stuck in the Stone Age are heading?

*Back in the Stone Age!*
The world is marching towards AI and automation. It’s time for businesses like yours to do the same. 
Customers are royalty, and we totally get it. To keep your kings (and queens) happy, you might be considering hiring more support staff, which means spending more money, time, and resources.
Before you post the customer support job on LinkedIn, let’s present you with something better: AI-powered support chatbots like Enum.
If you are still on the fence about having a chatbot for your business, keep reading this article to discover how AI Chatbots are revolutionizing customer service in 2025. 

## 1. Enhanced Cost and Time Efficiency 

Money keeps a business alive. So why drain it when cost-effective (or even free) solutions exist?
Hiring human staff comes at a cost. No one wants to work tirelessly without fair compensation. If you hire a person to assist your customers, he will demand pay, and rightfully so. 
Besides their wages, you must also factor in the time to train them before they can extend their support to customers and their limitations as a human. With businesses shifting online and reaching nooks and crannies of the world, visitors can come to your website or social handles with queries at any time. 
Can a human rep sit around the clock throughout the work week to be available for potential customers?

*You already know the answer to that question.*

Imagine a person lands on your Instagram page and loves your product. They are eager to purchase but have a few questions regarding the customization. They send the message on Instagram, and…the customer support person is on a bathroom break. 
The result?

**No reply = No sale** 

But, having an AI-powered support chatbot stifles these issues. They are available around the clock and require no bathroom breaks, bonuses, or health insurance. 

The best part?

They won’t resign because they found a better opportunity. With AI chatbots, both you and your customers win

## 2. Swift Issue Resolution and Scalability 


You’ll be shocked to learn that many [businesses lose around 78% of customers due to poor customer service](https://www.helpscout.com/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics). 
And what exactly is poor customer service? Slow responses, delayed solutions, or not understanding the customer’s query. All these factors can create an unsatisfactory customer experience, and you surely wouldn’t want it. 

Your human customer staff can be great, but they cannot:

- Handle 1000s of queries at once
- Stay available during holidays 
- Remember the past conversation 
- Memorize each product's price, features, and description on your website. 

But, doing all this is a piece of cake for chatbots like Enum. 
You can upload your documents or type out the information to feed Enum. Or, you can leave it to its app to devour the contents of your website. Once Enum has all the information, it is good to go!

It will remember everything about your website and answer your customers swiftly and accurately. 

In 2025, businesses are leaping towards scalability without draining their time and budget. And AI is their ally. Swiftness and scalability will be the major revolutionizing features for customer support in 2025.

## 3. AI-Driven Personalization 

Businesses no longer see customers as their ATMs only. Rather, they believe in establishing a connection with them and earning loyalty. 
Therefore, businesses must understand what their customers want, their issues, and what they like. 

```
“If a customer likes you — and continues to like you — they will continue to do business with you. If they don’t, they won’t.”

Paul Greenberg
```
Sure, a human sales rep can do that. 
But can Tom, the customer support agent, remember Sophie’s inquiry about a product’s availability in hot pink color at 3 am on a random Thursday?

*It’s a total no-brainer for cutting-edge AI support tools like Enum.*

They can keep track of individual conversations, understand their context, and respond to the customer, tailoring to their specific needs. Personalized responses make visitors stay on your website or social handles and influence their decision about becoming your customers. 
Savvy businesses are leveraging the power of personalization, and it’s not just humans doing it. Rather, AI chatbots play a pivotal role. 

Enum has taken the personalization game a notch or two up; this smart AI support chatbot is capable of:
- Responding in more than 100 languages 
- Show the relevant links in responses 
- Understanding images uploaded by users 
- Recognizing and understanding voice messages in above 100 audio formats. 
- Integrating all the social handles with just a click.
- 
With AI-powered chatbots like Enum, you can effortlessly elevate customer satisfaction to the next level. 

## 4. Instant Feedback and Timely Improvisation 

Businesses that ignore customer feedback often struggle to survive. One of the [best ways to stay in the market and generate leads](https://enumhq.com/blog/posts/help-your-users-and-beat-competitors/) is *to listen to your customers*. 

Customers are your biggest stakeholders, without them, your products and services become expenses rather than revenue generators. Hence, always take into consideration what your customers have to say. Sometimes, customer feedback can put you far ahead of your competition. 

But here’s the pickle: Customers do not really warm up to providing feedback about the customer service they receive. 
And here’s where support chatbots seamlessly step in to bridge the gap. Chatbots ask for customer feedback in real-time and store their responses. Based on customers’ feedback, businesses can tweak changes in their support strategy to keep the customers happy.

Chatbots, like Enum, provide the option of adding custom buttons to the chat to intake the user’s response. Businesses can add buttons asking for feedback on the chat, requesting a human operator, or marking the issue as resolved. 

These responses allow businesses to analyze the support chatbot’s performance and determine how to enhance it further.
