### Why we started our Affiliate program
We started our affiliate program to make more money. Yes, that's simple. But actually, it's not that simple. This is a multi-variable equation, let's go through all of them:

1. Our clients - we want more clients which means more money but, on the other hand, it means more feature requests and bug reports that eventually will improve our product and make it outstanding.
2. Users of our clients - with better automated support, they will be happier... you probably didn't think that simple, good support can make someone a happier, more loyal user.
3. People who can help us and make money - YOU. 500,000 companies already use Crisp but we have slightly more than 1,000 of them, so 499,000 of them are waiting for you to give you and us their money and automate their support. So, what are you waiting for?

But, before we begin, here are a couple of words about why automated support is a really great idea.

### Why a chatbot

1. If you do not have team members in different time zones, that means that you can't provide 24/7 support for your users worldwide.
2. What's the point of loading your team with not-so-complicated questions that your chatbot can answer?
3. Chatbot can answer better because it searches the relevant data faster and more precisely.
4. **Our** chatbot can do much more than just answer questions: it can check the parcel status, search on the Internet, and make a custom call to a third-party API.


### How it works
Now, let's see how the whole program works:

1. You set up your account in our program (currently, we use the PromoteKit service for it).
2. You find some company that would like to install our chatbot plugin for their Crisp.
3. You provide them with the promo code (coupon) which is generated specially for you.
4. When they are satisfied with the result of a free plan, they decide to buy a plan.
5. During the payment process, they enter the promo code and immediately get a 10% discount.
6. Internally, we know, that this promo code is for you, and you immediately get 20% of the plan's price.
7. We all three win!
